# WeaponStats

Easily find weapon stats for any weapon in GTFO.
Requires python and PySimpleGUI to be installed.
Python can be found at python.org
PySimpleGUI can be installed by opening Command Prompt/Powershell. 
Type "pip install PySimpleGUI".

To run the program, place WeaponStats.py in the same folder as all of your datablocks.
Right-click in that folder and select Open in Terminal/Powershell.
Type "python Weaponstats.py" and press enter.  
Simply select a weapon from the drop down menu and click Search.
Currently only works for MTFO datablocks and not PartialData.
